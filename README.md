## WnCC Recruitment: Backend Assignment

Greetings,

I'm pleased to introduce a website I developed for the second technical question in the WnCC recruitment assignment. Regrettably, I wasn't able to create an equivalent frontend to complement the backend functionalities.

Here are the key features of my website:

This platform comprises APIs tailored for player registration and login, ensuring smooth accessibility for users. Upon registration and login, players gain the ability to form their own teams or join existing ones.

To ensure team integrity, I've implemented a unique feature known as "code." Each team is assigned a distinct code by its leader, serving as a safeguard against unauthorized team entries. Prospective members must possess this code, shared by the team leader, to join a team. Additionally, I've enforced a constraint wherein each team comprises precisely four members.

Once a team is established, members can collaboratively create and view scripts within the platform. Furthermore, they retain the option to modify these scripts as desired.

Within the application, I've incorporated a game engine named "RPS" (Rock, Paper, Scissors). This feature enables teams to engage in friendly competitions by submitting their choices, with the engine generating outcomes accordingly. Members can select opponents and execute their scripts, receiving real-time feedback on their performance. Additionally, statistical data is stored to evaluate the effectiveness of each team's script relative to others.

I hope this overview provides insight into the functionality and design considerations of my website.
